This is an incomplete set of FFI bindings for the GraphicsMagick
library. You will need to install GraphicsMagick first -- see:
   
   http://www.graphicsmagick.org/

I have tested these bindings with GraphicsMagick 1.1.10.

Please submit bug reports, feedback, complaints, praise, and
especially patches to me at:

I did a lot of this work during the second Haskell Hackathon (Hac II
'07) in Freiburg in September 2007. I'd like to thank all the
attendees at Hac II for their moral support, particularly Duncan
Coutts for help with the FFI, as well as: Mark Jones, the members of
the Portland Functional Programming Study Group, and David MacIver,
for their encouragement.
